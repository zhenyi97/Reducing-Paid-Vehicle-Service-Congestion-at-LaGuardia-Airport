# Reducing-Paid-Vehicle-Service-Congestion-at-LaGuardia-Airport
Project for Big Data in Transportation


Included is the presentation, report, and project code files for the project. This project was written in Python 3 using Jupyter Labs from Anaconda.

The code uses csv database files from NYC and US databases for flight data, green/yellow taxi data in NYC, For Hire Vehicle data in NYC, as well as NYC Bus Schedules in 2017. All of the data was publiclyaccessible at time of coding the project.

The presentation slides were used as a reference. The slides that included 4 maps in the Evaluation Process section was animated to show 
visible congestion comparisons on each day throughout the month, but this animation is not transferable into the pdf file. The report serves to explain the entire project as well as conlusions and future suggestions.
